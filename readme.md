## Server Life Cycle Manager
Server Life Cycle Manager module is responsible for allocating server on which service life cycle manager can run an algorithm. 
* Server life cycle manager allocates server instance in such a way that computational load among all the avilable servers remains evenly distributed.
* It also decides whether to bring more server instances if all the serves are under more than threshold load.
* For new server instances the server life cycle manager is responsible to install docker and run machine agent code on the instance.
### Data Flow
1. Service life cycle manager will request for a server instance details on it's REST API.
2. Server life cycle manger will hit the REST API of monitoring module & will receive current statistics of all the servers in the following format
```json
{
  "n_servers": 1,
  "server_load": [
    {
      "ip": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 22,
      "free_cpu": 32.1,
      "free_mem": 3.1,
      "number_of_events_per_sec": 22000,
      "free_RAM": 4.1,
      "temperature": 19.2,
      "n_cores": 2,
      "load_average_1": 1.48,
      "load_average_5": 0.62,
      "load_average_15": 0.53
    }
  ]
}
```
3. Then it will calculate average load per core for previous 1 minute & 5 minutes using formula as shown below:
```
Average Load (1 minute or 5 minutes) / Number of CPU cores
```
4. If average load per core is greater than equal to 0.8 or 0.7 for previous 1 minute or 5 minutes respectively no more algorithms will be run on that server.
5. Now server manager will calculate load factor on each server where higher load factor implies less load, then will select server having highest load factor.

```
Coefficient 1 = 1/[ (3/% free CPU) + (1/% free memory) ]
Coefficient 2 = number of events per second / 10000 + min(2,free memory)/10
Coefficient 3 = 0 if CPU temperature greater than critical temperature else 1

Load Factor = (Coefficient 1) * (Coefficient 2) * (Coefficient 3)
```
6. If no server is available then it will request deatils for free available server & setup evironment along with run machine agent code.
7. Finally it will return server details to service life cycle manager in json format as shown below
```json
{
	"result":"RESPONSE RESULT",
	"ip":"127.0.0.1",
	"username":"root",
	"password":"******",
	"port":22
}

```
## Scheduler
Job Scheduler â€‹ module is responsible to run/send jobs to service life cycle manager at predetermined intervals. Request Manager is responsible to request scheduler for scheduling service by invoking an API call exposed by scheduler.The Request manager will pass the information in the following format
```python
{
  "username": "useruniqueid",
  "application_id": "application_id",
  "service_name": "service_name",
  "singleinstance":True,
  "time": {
    "start": [
      "01:12",
      "05:00"
    ],
    "end": [
      "01:31",
      "06:00"
    ]
  }
  "days":["Monday"]
  "period":None
}
```
Single Instance refers that that this service needs to run only once for all the predetmined times given in the "start" tag and stop these services at the time given in "end" tag. If the single instance is False ,then either days tag will be active or period tag ,both cannot be active at the same time.The days tag will define the days on which the service needs to get schedule again again. if period tag is active ,then the service needs to get scheduled after every "period" days , where the period will be an integer.
